# task-automation-api

You have joined the operations team at DataWorks Solutions, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

Due to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks.

Your assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain‑English tasks, carries out the required (multi‑step) process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre‑computed expected results.
